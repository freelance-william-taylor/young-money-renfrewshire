# Young Money Renfrewshire

Young Money Renfrewshire is a custom tailored website for the charity Barnardos. It is an application for under 25s who can help with your financial problems. We can help with budgeting, where to find deals and where to find the best advice. The application was built in collaboration with the Poverty Alliance, Barnardos staff and Renfewshire Council.

## Introduction

Youngmoneyren.org was a custom made website for Barnardos. It provides information on local financial services in the Renfrewshire council area and a selection of tools as well. It was designed to be a write once run anywhere app and uses Electron and Cacoon.io to bring it to the desktop and to mobile. The tools it provides include a monthly calculator providing a forecast for monthly finances and breaks the information down for the user. There is also a Bank Map tool which highlights local banks, credit unions and financial services in Paisley. Finally, there is an admin dashboard so data on the website can be changed dynamically to users.

## Requirements

To locally test and run to the website, Webpack + Minify will need to be globally installed via npm. Once they have you can use the following npm scripts to launch builds.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

```
